# Exercise 1 : Pets

# Using this code:

class Pets():
    def __init__(self, animals):
        self.animals = animals

    def walk(self):
        for animal in self.animals:
            print(animal.walk())

class Cat():
    is_lazy = True

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def walk(self):
        return f'{self.name} is just walking around'

class Bengal(Cat):
    def sing(self, sounds):
        return f'{sounds}'

class Chartreux(Cat):
    def sing(self, sounds):
        return f'{sounds}'
    
class Siamese(Cat):
    def sing(self, sounds):
        return f'{sounds}'
        

#     Create another cat breed named Siamese which inherits from the Cat class.
#     Create a list called all_cats, which holds three cat instances : one Bengal, one Chartreux and one Siamese.
#     Those three cats are Saraâ€™s pets. Create a variable called sara_pets which value is an instance of the Pet class, and pass the variable all_cats to the new instance.
#     Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method.
