# Challenge 1
#     Ask a user for a word
#     Write a program that creates a dictionary. This dictionary stores the indexes of each letter in a list.
#         Make sure the letters are the keys.
#         Make sure the letters are strings.
#         Make sure the indexes are stored in a list and those lists are values.

# Examples
# "dodo" ➞ { "d": [0, 2], "o": [1, 3] }
# "froggy" ➞ { "f":  [0], "r": [1], "o": [2], "g": [3, 4], "y": [5] }
# "grapes" ➞ { "g": [0], "r": [1], "a": [2], "p": [3]}
