/*
Exercise 1 : Comparison
Instructions

    Create a function called compareToTen(num) that takes a number as an argument.
    The function should return a Promise:
        the promise resolves if the argument is less than or equal to 10
        the promise rejects if argument is greater than 10.

Test:

//In the example, the promise should reject
compareToTen(15)
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.log(error))

//In the example, the promise should resolve
compareToTen(8)
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.log(error))
