/**Exercise 1: Building a RESTful API
Instructions
Youâ€™re tasked with building a RESTful API for a blog platform.
Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete blog posts using different endpoints.
    Create a directory named blog-api.
    Inside the blog-api directory, open a terminal and run npm init to initialize a new Node.js project. Follow the prompts to set up your project.
    Install the express package by running npm install express in the terminal.
    Create a file named server.js.
    In server.js, require the express package and set up an Express app.
    Create a data array to simulate a database. Each item in the array should represent a blog post with properties like id, title, and content.
    Implement the following routes using Express:
        GET /posts: Return a list of all blog posts.
        GET /posts/:id: Return a specific blog post based on its id.
        POST /posts: Create a new blog post.
        PUT /posts/:id: Update an existing blog post.
        DELETE /posts/:id: Delete a blog post.
    Implement error handling for invalid routes and server errors.
    Start the Express app and listen on a specified port (e.g., 3000).

const express = require('express');

const app = express();

let blog_posts = [
    {"id": 1, "title": "What we did last summer", "content": "content about the past"},
    {"id": 2, "title": "What we're doing this summer", "content": "content about present time"},
    {"id": 3, "title": "What we'll do next summer", "content": "content about the future"}
];





app.listen(5000, () => {
    console.log("server is running on port:5000");
});
