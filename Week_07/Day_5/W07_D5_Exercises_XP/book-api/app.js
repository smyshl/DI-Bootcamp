/**Exercise 2: Building a Basic CRUD API with Express.js
Instructions
In this exercise, you’ll build a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using Express.js. Your task is to create routes to manage a collection of books.
    Create a new directory named book-api.
    Inside the book-api directory, initialize a new Node.js project and install the express package.
    Create a new file named app.js in the book-api directory.
    In app.js, import the express module and create an instance of an Express app.
    Define a basic data array containing a few book objects. Each book object should have properties like id, title, author, and publishedYear.
    Set up the app to listen on port 5000. Print a message in the console to indicate that the server is running.
    Implement the “Read all” route by defining a route at GET /api/books. Send a JSON response with the books array.
    Implement the “Read” route by defining a route at GET /api/books/:bookId. Extract the bookId parameter from the URL and use it to find the corresponding book in the books array. If the book is found, send a JSON response with the book details and a status code of 200 (OK). If the book is not found, send a 404 status with a “Book not found” message.
    Implement the “Create” route at POST /api/books. Use the express.json() middleware to parse JSON body content. Inside the route handler, create a new book object with an incremented ID and the data from the request body. Add the new book to the books array and return a JSON response with the new book and a status code of 201 (Created).

const express = require ('express');

const app = express();

let books = [
    {"id": 1, "title": "Book 1", "author": "Author 1", "publishedYear": 2000},
    {"id": 2, "title": "Book 2", "author": "Author 2", "publishedYear": 1990},
    {"id": 3, "title": "Book 3", "author": "Author 3", "publishedYear": 2010},
];


app.listen(5000, () => {
    console.log("server is running on port:5000");
});
